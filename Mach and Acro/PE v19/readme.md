# bo4p5687 - update

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Adds the Support for Acro Bikes and Mach Bikes!

#

#  How to use:

#    - Insert Script

#       + Puts the files in 'Mach and acro bike.rar' in \Plugins\Mach and acro bike (You need to create folder Mach and acro bike in folder Plugins)

#

#  How To Use (Acro Bike):

#    - Edit the AcroBikeFileName Setting to what your Acro Bike Graphics would be

#    - ADD THE GRAPHICS INTO THE CHARACTERS FOLDER

#    - ADD THE ITEM "ACROBIKE" (The internal name must be ACROBIKE at the very

#       least)

#

#  How To Use (Mach Bike):

#   - ADD THE ITEM "MACHBIKE" (The internal name must be MACHBIKE at the very

#       least)

#

#  How to create Acro Bike Rails:

#   - Go into the Tileset Editor (through DEBUG mode or Essentials)

#   - Find your desired Acro Bike Rails and set their Terrain Tag to (18 for Up/Down Rails) or (19 for Left/Right Rails)

#   - Go into RMXP's tileset editor and set the passages (4dir) of the rails

#     to what it would normally be to pass (EG: Rails left and right need the

#     left and right passages open but the top and bottom closed)

#

#

#  How to create Acro Bike Stepping Stones:

#   - Go into the Tileset Editor (through DEBUG mode or Essentials)

#   - Find your desired Acro Bike Stepping Stones and set their Terrain Tag to 20

#   - Go into RMXP's tileset editor and set the passages of the stepping stones

#     to impassable (the script will allow you to move on them while hopping)

#

#  How to create Mach Bike Slopes:

#   - Go into the Tileset Editor (through DEBUG mode or Essentials)

#   - Find your desired Mach Bike Slopes and set their Terrain Tag to 21

#   - Go into RMXP's tileset editor and set the passages of the slope to passable
